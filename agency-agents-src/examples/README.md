# Examples

This directory contains example outputs demonstrating how the agency's agents can be orchestrated together to tackle real-world tasks.

## Why This Exists

The agency-agents repo defines dozens of specialized agents across engineering, design, marketing, product, support, spatial computing, and project management. But agent definitions alone don't show what happens when you **deploy them all at once** on a single mission.

These examples answer the question: _"What does it actually look like when the full agency collaborates?"_

**What:** A complete product discovery exercise where 8 agents worked in parallel to evaluate a software opportunity and produce a unified plan.

**The scenario:** Web research identified an opportunity at the intersection of AI agent orchestration and spatial computing. The entire agency was then deployed simultaneously to produce:

- Market validation and competitive analysis
- Technical architecture (8-service system design with full SQL schema)
- Brand strategy and visual identity
- Go-to-market and growth plan
- Customer support operations blueprint
- UX research plan with personas and journey maps
- 35-week project execution plan with 65 sprint tickets
- Spatial interface architecture specification

**Agents used:**

| Agent                    | Role                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Product Trend Researcher | Market validation, competitive landscape    |
| Backend Architect        | System architecture, data model, API design |
| Brand Guardian           | Positioning, visual identity, naming        |
| Growth Hacker            | GTM strategy, pricing, launch plan          |
| Support Responder        | Support tiers, onboarding, community        |
| UX Researcher            | Personas, journey maps, design principles   |
| Project Shepherd         | Phase plan, sprints, risk register          |
| XR Interface Architect   | Spatial UI specification                    |

**Key takeaway:** All 8 agents ran in parallel and produced coherent, cross-referencing plans without coordination overhead. The output demonstrates the agency's ability to go from "find an opportunity" to "here's the full blueprint" in a single session.

## Adding New Examples

If you run an interesting multi-agent exercise, consider adding it here. Good examples show:

- Multiple agents collaborating on a shared objective
- The breadth of the agency's capabilities
- Real-world applicability of the agent definitions

## 输出格式

输出完整的分析报告（自然语言，可包含 Markdown 表格/清单/推理过程），
然后在**末尾另起一行**追加机读标签：

```
<!-- VERDICT: {"结论": "...", "置信度": 70, "关键发现": []} -->
```

VERDICT 标签字段说明：

- `结论`: 你的核心判断结论
- `置信度`: 0-100 整数
- `关键发现`: 字符串数组，列出最重要的发现

**关键规则**：

1. 报告正文是自由自然语言，任意格式都可以
2. VERDICT 标签必须是输出内容的**最后一行**
3. VERDICT 内部 JSON 必须合法（键名用双引号、无尾逗号）
4. 所有结论必须有数据支撑——没有数据就说"数据不可用"
5. 识别不确定之处并标注置信度

## 参考示例

```
[你的完整分析报告内容]

<!-- VERDICT: {"结论": "...", "置信度": 70, "关键发现": ["发现1", "发现2"]} -->
```

## 自检

- [ ] 报告是否包含了所有关键数据和推理过程？
- [ ] 所有结论是否有实际数据支撑（不是猜测）？
- [ ] VERDICT 标签是否在最后一行且 JSON 合法？
- [ ] 置信度是否如实反映了数据完整度？
- [ ] 如果数据不可用，是否已明确标注？
